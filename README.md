We are trying to make a simple 2d physics engine. We had a bad programmer take a crack at it and he sort of got it working but it has bugs and no documentation. He is no longer with the company and none of us know how his code works. We would like you to:

* Fix the bugs such that the circles and rectangles draw and move properly. Have them start moving randomly around at first, then when you hit spacebar have them move towards each other. Bonus points if you can make them meet at a point at the same time.
* Implement the checkCollisions function such that it returns true if any shapes collide with each other and the code stops running
* Add some comments to explain what the heck is going on here
* Implement triangles and add them to the checkCollisions function as well

We understand that you probably won't have time to do everything so you have to prioritize what you think would be the best deliverable to wow the client. Feel free to use any external resources you have including google, stack exchange, etc.
